# BASIC TETRIS
**A simple Tetris game made in Javascript based on the tutorial by Ania Kubow [@kubowania](https://github.com/kubowania) for *freecodecamp*.** 






**This game/project is hosted on github.io and can be viewed here: [Basic Tetris](https://mtc-20.github.io/Tetris_js/)**




This is my first ~~project~~ time with both javascript and CSS, and I think this was a good introduction.
